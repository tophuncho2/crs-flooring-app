# Sweep 2 — Cut-Log Domain Audit (Pre-Implementation)

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Scope:** Inventory the current `packages/domain/src/flooring/inventory/cut-logs/`
surface, compare against the canonical staged-inventory-rows / imports
domain pattern, and flag every stale planning artifact that needs to be
rewritten or removed before sweep 2 (the cut-log domain rebuild) starts.
**Companion docs:** [cut-logs-finalize-and-void-intent.md](cut-logs-finalize-and-void-intent.md),
[sweep-1-cut-log-schema-alteration-report.md](sweep-1-cut-log-schema-alteration-report.md),
[sweeps/alteration/2_domain.md](sweeps/alteration/2_domain.md) (empty placeholder).

## TL;DR

- Cut-log domain has 7 files (`types`, `editability`, `errors`,
  `cut-log-rules`, `finalize-payload`, `category-math`, `index`).
- **2 survive untouched** (`errors.ts`, `category-math.ts`); **2 need
  extension** (`types.ts`, `editability.ts`); **1 needs heavy rewrite**
  (`cut-log-rules.ts`); **1 should be moved + expanded into 3**
  (`finalize-payload.ts`).
- **Zero worker / outbox scaffolding outside the domain layer** — no stale
  handler, processor, dispatcher, application use case, or topic
  registration to remove. The "previous plan" the user remembers boils
  down to `finalize-payload.ts` only; everything else is greenfield.
- Cut logs are **missing 5 file-shaped concepts** that staged-inv has:
  per-row form validator, batch-readiness validator, diff-save scaffolding
  (3 files), and the queue-payload location convention
  (`packages/domain/src/queue/` instead of inside the entity folder).
- One layering violation persists: `types.ts` imports
  `FlooringCutLogStatus` directly from `@prisma/client`; sweep 2 must
  re-route through `@builders/db`.

## Reference: staged-inventory / imports domain (the template)

### `packages/domain/src/flooring/imports/`

Top-level "imports" entity files:

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `index.ts` | Barrel re-export of all sibling files + the `staged-inventory-rows/` sub-barrel. |
| `errors.ts` | `ImportDomainError` class + `ImportDomainErrorCode` string union. Constructor: `(code, message)`. |
| `editability.ts` | Field-partition constants (`USER_EDITABLE`, `WORKER_FIELDS`, `AUTO_FIELDS`) + `is*Field` type guards. |
| `types.ts` | Read shape (`ImportRow`), form shape (`ImportPrimaryForm`), enum shapes (`ImportFormOptions`), `EMPTY_*` constants, `to*Form()` helper. |
| `form-rules.ts` | Per-record form validator returning `Issue[]`. Named `validateImportPrimaryForm`. Companion `describe*Issue()` for human text. |
| `delete-rules.ts` | Predicate `isImportDeleteBlocked(state)` + message builder `buildImportDeleteBlockedMessage(state)`. |
| `warehouse-rules.ts` | Same shape as `delete-rules.ts` for parent-change blocking. |
| `filters.ts` | List-page filter parsers (dedup, trim, validate). |

### `packages/domain/src/flooring/imports/staged-inventory-rows/`

The per-row sub-domain that cut logs should mirror most closely:

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `index.ts` | Barrel. |
| `types.ts` | `StagedInventoryRow` (full read shape — includes both `status` enum AND `isImported` latch), `StagedInventoryForm`, enum re-exports. |
| `editability.ts` | **Lifecycle predicates** (`isStagedRowEditable`, `isStagedRowQueued`, `isStagedRowMaterialized`, `canDeleteStagedRow`); **importability validator** (`getStagedRowImportabilityBlocker` returning a `StagedImportabilityReason` or null, plus `canImportStagedRow`); **message builder** (`buildStagedRowNotDraftMessage`); **field partition** constants. All in one file. |
| `errors.ts` | `StagedInventoryDomainError` + `StagedInventoryDomainErrorCode` union (11 codes covering validation, lock, mismatch, ineligibility). |
| `form-rules.ts` | Per-row form validator. `validateStagedInventoryForm(input, location?)` → `StagedInventoryValidationIssue[]`. `describe*Issue()` + `describe*Issues()` companions. |
| `import-batch-rules.ts` | **Batch-readiness validator**. `validateStagedImportBatch(rows)` walks each row through `getStagedRowImportabilityBlocker()` and returns `[{rowId, reason}]`. `buildStagedImportBatchIneligibleMessage(issues)` companion. This is the gate the producer use case calls before flipping rows to `QUEUED`. |
| `diff/types.ts` | Diff-save shapes: `*Draft` (with `tempId`), `*Patch` (optional fields only), `*Update` (id + `expectedUpdatedAt` + patch), `*Delete`, `*Diff` (`{added, modified, deleted}`), `*ParentContext`, issue-union, describe helpers. |
| `diff/rules.ts` | `validateStagedInventoryRowsDiff(diff, resolution, parent)` — multi-row batch validator. Calls predicates from `editability.ts`. |
| `diff/identity.ts` | `assignStagedInventoryDiffIds(entries, generateId)` + `buildStagedInventoryTempIdMap(entries)`. **Pure** — application injects the UUID generator. |

### `packages/domain/src/queue/`

Outbox-event / worker-queue payload schemas live OUTSIDE the entity
folders, in a flat `queue/` directory:

- `materialize-import-batch.ts` — exports `IMPORT_MATERIALIZE_TOPIC`,
  `IMPORT_MATERIALIZE_QUEUE`, `IMPORT_MATERIALIZE_JOB_NAME`,
  `ImportMaterializeBatchPayloadSchema` (Zod), `ImportMaterializeBatchPayload`
  type, `parseImportMaterializeBatchPayload(value)` parser.

**Payload schema convention:**

```ts
export const X_TOPIC = "flooring.subdomain.action" as const
export const X_QUEUE = "flooring-subdomain-action" as const
export const X_JOB_NAME = "action-batch" as const

export const XPayloadSchema = z.object({
  version: z.literal("v1"),
  topic: z.literal(X_TOPIC),
  // entity ids (denormalized parent for FOR UPDATE locks)
  // batch row ids (min 1, max 500)
  requestedBy: z.object({ userId: z.string().uuid(), userEmail: z.string().email() }),
  requestedAt: z.string().datetime(),
})

export type XPayload = z.infer<typeof XPayloadSchema>
export function parseXPayload(value: unknown): XPayload { return XPayloadSchema.parse(value) }
```

### Conventions distilled

1. **Errors** — one class per sub-domain, code as string union, constructor `(code, message)`.
2. **Predicates** — return `boolean`, named `is*` / `can*` / `should*`.
3. **Validators** — return `Issue[]` (empty = pass), named `validate*`. Issues are discriminated unions with `code` + context.
4. **Message builders** — colocated with the rule that produces the issue. Named `build*Message(input)` or `describe*Issue(issue)`.
5. **Field splits** — `const` readonly tuples named `*_USER_EDITABLE_FIELDS`, `*_WORKER_FIELDS`, `*_AUTO_FIELDS` + `is*Field()` type guards.
6. **Zod payloads** — schema + inferred type + parser function in `packages/domain/src/queue/<topic>.ts`. Topics use `domain.subdomain.action`. Max batch 500 rows. `version: "v1"` literal first.
7. **Diff-save** — three-file split (`diff/types.ts`, `diff/rules.ts`, `diff/identity.ts`). Diff-rules call lifecycle predicates from `editability.ts` for lock checks. Identity helpers are pure with injected UUID generator.

## Current cut-log domain inventory

### `packages/domain/src/flooring/inventory/cut-logs/`

| File | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index.ts` | KEEP, extend exports | Barrel — must surface any new files added in sweep 2. |
| `types.ts` | **EXTEND + FIX** | (a) `CutLogRow` missing the 3 new sweep-1 fields (`isFinal`, `cutLogNumber`, `finalCutSequence`). (b) Direct `@prisma/client` import — **guard:prisma violation**, must re-route through `@builders/db`. (c) No `CutLogForm` shape, no `EMPTY_CUT_LOG_FORM`, no `toCutLogForm(record)` helper — staged-inv has these. |
| `editability.ts` | **EXTEND + REWRITE COMMENT** | Stale leading comment claims "lifecycle is PENDING → FINAL → VOID" — wrong since sweep 1 added `QUEUED`. Field partition is missing `isFinal` (worker-set), `cutLogNumber` (auto/sequence-backed), `finalCutSequence` (worker-set). No lifecycle predicates (`isCutLogPendingEditable`, `isCutLogQueued`, `isCutLogFinalized`, `isCutLogVoided`) — those are the staged-inv `editability.ts` shape. |
| `errors.ts` | **KEEP, extend codes** | The class is fine. Codes are reusable. Sweep 2 will add a few new codes for batch-finalize, batch-pending-save, void-already-final, etc. |
| `cut-log-rules.ts` | **HEAVILY REWRITE** | (a) `formatCutLogStatus()` is missing the `QUEUED` case. (b) `assertCutLogUserTransition` hardcodes the 3-value transition graph (`PENDING→FINAL`, `PENDING→VOID`, `FINAL→VOID`); needs to decide whether `QUEUED` is user-visible at all (intent doc says it's worker-internal — so users should NEVER write status; the transition validator may not be needed at all post-sweep-2). (c) `assertCutLogReadyToFinalize` checks `status !== "PENDING"` but should also check `isFinal === false` for watertight invariant. (d) Several rules predate the worker-driven model (e.g. `assertCutLogDeleteAllowed`, `isCutLogMostRecent`) and need to be re-evaluated against "PENDING rows can be freely add/edit/delete; non-PENDING rows are immutable except for the work-order-link separate flow". |
| `finalize-payload.ts` | **MOVE + EXPAND TO 3** | Currently lives inside the entity folder; staged-inv convention places payloads in `packages/domain/src/queue/`. Schema is missing `version: "v1"` literal, has no `QUEUE` or `JOB_NAME` constants, and is single-row (no `cutLogIds: z.array(...).min(1).max(500)` for batches). Per intent doc, three worker jobs are needed: `pending-save`, `finalize`, `void`. **One file becomes three.** |
| `category-math.ts` | **KEEP** | Pure `computeCutCoverage()` math wrapping `convertStockToCoverage`. No schema/enum dependencies. Reusable as-is. |

### Cut-log references outside the domain layer

- `apps/worker/` — **none.** No cut-log handler / processor file exists.
- `apps/relay/` — **none.** No cut-log dispatcher.
- `packages/application/` — only `delete-inventory.ts` does a count-based check on `state.cutLogsCount` (parent inventory deletion guard). No finalize/void/save use cases exist.
- `packages/db/src/queues/` — no cut-log topics registered.
- `packages/domain/src/queue/` — only `materialize-import-batch.ts` (the staged-inv payload). No cut-log files.

**Conclusion:** the user's recollection of "previous plan worker logic" is real but limited — it's the standalone `finalize-payload.ts` inside the entity folder. There is **no live wiring** to dismantle. Sweep 2 is essentially greenfield for the worker contract; it just needs to relocate + expand `finalize-payload.ts` and rewrite the rule files against the new schema.

## Gap analysis — what cut logs are MISSING vs the staged-inv pattern

| Concept | Staged-inv has | Cut-log has |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-row form validator | `staged-inventory-rows/form-rules.ts` | **MISSING** |
| Batch-readiness validator | `staged-inventory-rows/import-batch-rules.ts` | **MISSING** |
| Lifecycle predicates | `editability.ts` (`isStagedRowEditable`, `isStagedRowQueued`, `isStagedRowMaterialized`, `canDeleteStagedRow`) | **MISSING** (only field partitions) |
| Importability blocker enum + reason builder | `editability.ts` (`StagedImportabilityReason` + `getStagedRowImportabilityBlocker` + `buildStagedRowNotDraftMessage`) | **MISSING** |
| Diff-save scaffolding | `diff/types.ts`, `diff/rules.ts`, `diff/identity.ts` | **MISSING** (assumes diff-save lands as the pending-save mode — still TBD per intent doc) |
| Form shape + EMPTY constant + `toForm()` helper | `types.ts` (`ImportPrimaryForm`, `EMPTY_IMPORT_PRIMARY_FORM`, `toImportPrimaryForm`) | **MISSING** |
| Queue payload(s) in `packages/domain/src/queue/` | `materialize-import-batch.ts` (1 payload, the only worker job for staged-inv) | **MISPLACED** (`finalize-payload.ts` lives inside entity folder) and **INCOMPLETE** (single-row, no version, no QUEUE/JOB_NAME constants, only 1 of 3 needed) |
| Errors-class + code union | `errors.ts` (11 codes) | **HAVE** (9 codes — extend with batch-level codes during sweep 2) |
| Field partition + type guards | `editability.ts` | **HAVE** (5 partitions; needs new fields added) |
| Coverage / category math | N/A (different concern) | **HAVE** (`category-math.ts` — survives) |
| Parent-change / delete blocking predicate | `delete-rules.ts`, `warehouse-rules.ts` | **N/A** — cut logs don't have parent-change semantics (parent inventory is fixed at create); delete blocking lives in `cut-log-rules.ts` (`assertCutLogDeleteAllowed`). |

## Stale planning artifacts to scrap or rewrite

1. **`finalize-payload.ts`** — relocate to `packages/domain/src/queue/finalize-cut-log-batch.ts` and rewrite to match `materialize-import-batch.ts` shape (batch of `cutLogIds`, `version: "v1"`, `topic` literal, separate `QUEUE` + `JOB_NAME` constants, denormalized `inventoryId` for the parent FOR UPDATE lock). Add two siblings: `pending-save-cut-log-batch.ts`, `void-cut-log.ts` (single-row per the intent doc — voids are always one at a time).
2. **`cut-log-rules.ts` formatCutLogStatus** — must add the `QUEUED` case (probably "Queued" or "Processing").
3. **`cut-log-rules.ts` assertCutLogUserTransition** — likely delete entirely. Per intent doc, users never write `status` directly post-sweep-1 (worker owns it). The transition validator was a pre-worker-model artifact.
4. **`cut-log-rules.ts` assertCutLogReadyToFinalize** — tighten check from `status !== "PENDING"` to `(status !== "PENDING" || isFinal === true || void === true)`. Belt-and-suspenders against re-finalizing a finalized row.
5. **`cut-log-rules.ts` isCutLogMostRecent + assertCutLogDeleteAllowed** — re-evaluate against new rule "PENDING + non-final rows can be freely add/edit/delete". The most-recent constraint may not survive worker-driven finalize; or it may move into a batch-level invariant.
6. **`cut-log-rules.ts` buildVoidedCutLogPatch** — keep, but verify the new fields (`isFinal`, `finalCutSequence`) are NOT erased (only `cut`, `coverageCut`, `cost`, `freight` are erased per intent doc; `isFinal` and `finalCutSequence` should stay as historical record per the immutable-row philosophy).
7. **`editability.ts` lifecycle comment** — replace with the 4-value lifecycle.
8. **`types.ts` Prisma import** — re-route `FlooringCutLogStatus` import through `@builders/db` to satisfy `guard:prisma`. Mirror whatever the staged-inv `types.ts` does (note: staged-inv `types.ts` has the SAME violation per the sweep-1 report — both should be fixed, but only the cut-log one is in sweep-2 scope).

## Files that survive untouched

- `category-math.ts` — pure math.
- `errors.ts` — class + code union (extension only, no rewrite).

## Layering violation

`packages/domain/src/flooring/inventory/cut-logs/types.ts` lines 1 + 4
import / re-export `FlooringCutLogStatus` directly from `@prisma/client`,
violating `packages/CLAUDE.md` rule 1 (no `apps/` imports — but more
importantly, violating `packages/db/CLAUDE.md` which makes `@builders/db`
the sole owner of Prisma types). The `npm run guard:prisma` script
enforces this and currently fails because of this file (and a
sibling violation in `staged-inventory-rows/types.ts` outside scope).

**Sweep-2 fix:** ensure `@builders/db` exports `FlooringCutLogStatus`
through one of its public entry points (likely already does — verify in
`packages/db/src/index.ts`), then change the cut-log `types.ts` import
to `from "@builders/db"`.

## Proposed sweep-2 file layout

Plus the sweep-2 work updates `packages/domain/src/flooring/inventory/cut-logs/finalize-payload.ts` → DELETED (content moved to queue/ folder).

## Resolved (settled before sweep 2 implementation)

All open questions from this audit have been resolved. Sweep 2 plan
written at `~/.claude/plans/take-a-look-at-functional-falcon.md` and
approved 2026-04-26. See "Resolved decisions" section there for the
full list.

Quick summary of resolutions:

- **Pending-save mode** — diff-save with `tempId`, mirrors staged-inv
  `diff/{types,rules,identity}.ts` exactly. Triggered from canonical
  save / discard / dirty-slate controller.
- **Finalize** — clean-slate batch (UI gates the action when section
  has dirty edits). Worker writes only `before`, `after`,
  `finalCutSequence`, `status=FINAL`, `isFinal=true`.
- **Void** — single-row, worker-driven, always one-at-a-time. Worker
  writes `cut/coverageCut/cost/freight → null`, plus `void=true`,
  `status=VOID`. Preserves `isFinal`, `finalCutSequence`,
  `cutLogNumber`, `notes`, `isWaste`.
- **`finalCutSequence` allocator** — pure helper
  `nextFinalCutSequence(currentMax)` lives in domain
  (`cut-logs/final-cut-sequence.ts`); worker calls after its locked
  `MAX(finalCutSequence)` query.
- **Total cut-sum recalculation** — pure helpers
  `computeTotalCutSum(rows)` and
  `assertCutSumWithinStartingStock(sum, startingStock)` in
  `cut-logs/cut-sum-math.ts`. Single source of truth for the
  invariant `totalCutSum ≤ startingStock`. Used by every code path
  that mutates cuts.
- **`QUEUED` UI label** — confirmed: this is a real Postgres enum
  value (sweep 1 added it). The "label" question was about the UI
  string `formatCutLogStatus("QUEUED")` returns — chosen as `"Queued"`.
- **`assertCutLogUserTransition`** — DELETED. Users no longer write
  `status` post-sweep-1; worker owns transitions.
- **`isCutLogMostRecent`** — DELETED. Pending cut logs deletable in
  any order; finalized rows deletable not at all (only voidable).
- **`assertCutLogDeleteAllowed`** — REWRITTEN to wrap
  `canDeleteCutLog` (= PENDING + `!isFinal` + `!void` + not QUEUED).
- **Work-order-link CHECK constraint** — DEFERRED indefinitely.
  Domain rule `assertCutLogLinkageSymmetry` is sufficient. The DB
  CHECK question was just belt-and-suspenders ("would Postgres also
  reject an asymmetric row, even if the domain rule was bypassed?").
  Easy follow-up migration if hard DB enforcement is ever wanted.
- **Links editable for life** — `workOrderId` / `workOrderItemId`
  editable on PENDING, FINAL, VOID; blocked only while
  `status === "QUEUED"`. Link edits flow through their own sync use
  case (no worker); pending-save form does NOT carry links.
- **Scope confirmed** — sweep 2 is cut-log domain only. Data layer
  is sweep 3, application use cases sweep 4.
